# Flax Examples

Each example is designed to be self-contained and easily forkable, while reproducing relevant results in different areas of machine learning.

The gemma implementation is copied from the Flax [repository](https://github.com/google/flax/tree/main/examples/gemma) with modifications to accomodate for differences in model weight formatting.
